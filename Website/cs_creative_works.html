        <h1>Game Camp Game</h1>
        <p>Over the summer Weber State held a game development camp where we learned how to make a game using Gamemaker studio.
        This camp a had a competition where we split into groups of four and would make a game together and have the other teams vote on how good it was.
        My team actually manage to win this competition with a game called "Doomiez" (don't ask I didn't name it). I was the one who did all of the programing for the game.
