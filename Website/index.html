        <h1><strong>My Personal Statment</strong></h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In junior high I wasn’t really acknowledged by a lot of people mostly because I was a very closed off person, I didn’t really want to talk to people. I already had a few close friends from elementary school so I didn’t feel the need to meet new people and become friends. I just didn’t prioritize it. Now in high school I’ve learned the value of being on speaking terms with the people you interact with on a daily basis. Otherwise you’re so focused on schooling that you don’t notice what’s going around you. I still think that I only need a few friends that I am truly close to, friends that I can talk to about anything, friends that will stay my friend when life gets difficult. I have a friend that I’ve been friends with since the 3rd grade and we are still very close but, our friendship had its rough spots especially with early college and high school schedules. It’s been hard to find time to hang out. Even though we don’t hang out as much I think that when we do it is a lot more meaningful than it used to be because a lot of stuff happens between our conversations so we tend to be more selective in what we talk about.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;After 1st semester I’ll have three classes left for my associates and I’m really excited but I also feel very discouraged and just want it to be over with even though I’m so close. This happens a lot to me, I’ll work for something for so long and get so close to being done and then get discouraged and almost quit. However even when I get discouraged to the point where I feel like I won’t make it, I still see it through to the end because if I didn’t all that work would be for nothing. For example when I was in History 1700 my junior year our signature project was to interview someone about their life, record it, and then transcribe it, with a couple other steps. I decided to interview my dad because it had to be an older person and it was easiest to just interview my dad. After I had gotten the interview done and was transcribing I realized that there was a lot I needed to transcribe so I kept going. Near the end I almost gave up but if I had not only would that mean that I had wasted my time but also my dad’s time.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In junior year I had a class in the evening and it was a very mentally challenging class and I didn’t think that I would be able to pass the class. However, I didn’t want to just give up on the class even though it was a very difficult class. It also didn’t help that I was very packed with all of my other classes that were all college level. At the end of the day I still managed to pass the class even with several tests and it made me feel really proud of myself. A similar situation happened with my biology class that year because I spent a lot of time struggling to focus in that class and I really struggled remembering the content of the class. I still passed the class but I really wanted to quit. These experiences really helped me value seeing things through to the end especially when seeing things through becomes so much more rewarding than just giving up. When you have something that’s extremely hard to do and you feel like giving up and pushing through anyway feels amazingly satisfying.</p>
